# React Dictionary

## How I worked on this project 👩🏼‍💻

🚀 My goal was to continue practicing React by building a Dictionary App.

- I built this app based on a tutorial from Roadside Coder / freeCodeCamp.

## How to navigate this project 🧭

- Responsive CSS using Material UI.
- The application fetches data from the Dictionary API.

## Why I built the project this way 🚧

- I wanted to practice using React Hooks.
- Material UI is a great library for styling. Material UI components inherit style component syntax, which means you just need to import the component that you want to use and use it as a react component.
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually. But for the beginning I focus on the frontend. That's why I decided to use an existing API rather to create a custom server. I have basic backend knowledge as well.

## If I had more time I would change this ⌛

- I would add images, for the app to be more visual and intuitive. I would create another component and add it below the Definitions component.
